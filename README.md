# hello-world

Hello,
My name is Ido, I'm an Electronic Practical Engineer since 2011,
with an experience of 3 years in VHDL and FPGA development for optical devices.

Now a Math and English Private Tutor for middle and high school students,
and a Computer Science Student in Bar-Ilan University due to graduate in August 2020.

Currently looking for an internship, tutoring or research opportunity that will allow me to utilize my problem 
solving skills and attention to detail to further develop my abilities in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.
